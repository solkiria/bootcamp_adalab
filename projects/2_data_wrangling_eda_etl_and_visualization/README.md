# Data wrangling, EDA, ETL and visualization Project
## Introduction
An inmaginary client has given us some raw data and he needs to know some information contained in it. This folder has all the files used to unify all the data collected from the 5th survey from Kaggle on Machine learning & Data Science in 2021. The data has also been __cleaned__ and __explored__. Furthermore, some information contained in this data is __explained__, __showing__ graphs and explaining them in slides used during our demo meeting.

## Solution
The project files are organised as follows:
- code: it contains the code files.
    - __code_def.ipynb__ : containes all the code used for the ETL process.
- files: it contains the files given by our client and the resulting files after the ETL process.
    - abc.
- graphs: it contains all the images saved out of the code files.
    - abc.
- demo: it contains the slides used during our demo meeting with the product owner.
    - abc.

## Demo
As a practice of Agile and Scrum metodology, this project was done with 3 more partners. We did daily meetings everyday, we organised our task in a kanban framework, we worked all the project remotely and we did 2 sprints for this prject. At the end of both sprints we did a sprint review meeting and, finally, we did a demo meeting with the product owner presence. The presentation slides are in the 'PRESENTACIONFINAL4.pdf' file, there you can find all the explanation of the project and some of the graphs obtained.

## Conclusion
This was my second project. It is improvable, but it was a good beggining.
