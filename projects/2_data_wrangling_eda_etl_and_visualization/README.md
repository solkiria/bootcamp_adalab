# Data wrangling, EDA, ETL and visualization Project

## Introduction
This folder has all the files used unify all the data in the same file, __clean__ and __explore__ the data, __explain__ some information contained in this data __showing__ graphs and explaining them and the demo slides used during our demo meeting.

## Solution
The code created to solve our client's problem is organised as follows:
- code: it contains the code files.
    - __code_def.ipynb__ : abc.
- files: it contains the files given by our client and the resulting files after the ETL process.
    - abc.
- graphs: it contains all the images saved out of the code files.
    - abc.
- demo: it contains the slides used during our demo meeting with the product owner.
    - abc.

## Demo
As a practice of Agile and Scrum metodology, this project was done with 3 more partners. We did daily meetings everyday, we organised our task in a kanban framework, we worked all the project remotely and we did 2 sprints for this prject. At the end of both sprints we did a sprint review meeting and, finally, we did a demo meeting with the product owner presence. The presentation slides are in the 'PRESENTACIONFINAL4.pdf' file, there you can find all the explanation of the project and some of the graphs obtained.

## Conclusion
This was my second project. It is improvable, but it was a good beggining.
